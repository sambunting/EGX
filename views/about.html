		<h3>I'm bringing a young child with me, do I need to purchase a ticket for them?</h3>
		<p>Under 10s go free, however, please note that this offer is restricted to one child per ticket paying adult. Additional children will need to have tickets.</p>
		
		<a name="q6"></a>
		<h3>I bought a ticket but now I can't attend. Can I have a refund?</h3>
		<p>Alas, we aren't able to offer refunds, however, tickets are transferable so feel free to give your ticket to a friend. If you'd like to change the day of your ticket please contact us and we should be able to swap it. Bear in mind that we won't be able to switch the day of a ticket to a day that has sold out.</p>
		
		<a name="q7"></a>
		<h3>Do you offer complimentary tickets for carers?</h3>
		<p>We certainly do. Please contact us and we'll be happy to help.</p>
		
		<a name="q8"></a>
		<h3>I just bought a ticket or wristband on eBay / Gumtree / some dude in a pub...</h3>
		<p>If you purchased your ticket directly from this website you won't have a problem, however, beware! Tickets bought via third parties aren't guaranteed to be valid! Every barcode is unique, if you arrive at our registration desk and the barcode has already been scanned you will be turned away. Never purchase a wristband, it's almost certainly a fake.</p>
		
		<a name="q9"></a>
		<h3>Are there any age restrictions for EGX?</h3>
		<p>Visitors of all ages are welcome to attend, however, under 16s need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian. It's fine for one parent or guardian to accompany a group of under 16s. EGX will feature a number of 18+ rated games and developer sessions. Under 18s will not be permitted to play these games or attend these sessions even if they are accompanied by a parent.</p>
		
		<a name="q10"></a>
		<h3>>What forms of ID do you accept?</h3>
		<p>We're able to accept any form of photo ID that features your date of birth; passports, driving licenses etc. If you don't fancy bringing your ID a photocopy is acceptable. If you don't have any suitable ID we recommend applying for a <a href="http://www.citizencard.com/">citizen card</a>.</p>
		
		<a name="q11"></a>
		<h3>I can't print out my ticket! Now what?</h3>
		<p>Write down the long number below the barcode on your e-ticket and bring it with you. We can also scan tickets from most smartphones.</p>
		
		<a name="q12"></a>
		<h3>I'm organising a trip for a school, college or university and need an invoice.</h3>
		<p>No problem! Drop us a line via our contact page and we'll be happy to help. Please note, we will be happy to provide complimentary tickets for teachers / tutors who are attending EGX as part of a trip.</p>
		
		<a name="q13"></a>
		<h3>I have purchased a bunch of tickets for me and my friends but we won't be arriving at the same time. What should I do?</h3>
		<p>In this instance the first person to arrive should collect the wristbands for the party. This person will then need to leave the venue temporarily to pass on the remaining wristbands as their friends arrive.</p>
		
		<a name="q14"></a>

		<p>Great! Drop us a line via the contact form and we'll get straight back to you with a price list.</p>
		
		<a name="q15"></a>
		<h3>When are you announcing the games?</h3>
		<p>We're working hard to secure the best games and features for EGX 2015. We'll list everything on the website as soon as we can but please bear in mind that we need the go ahead from our exhibitors before we're able to reveal the goodies. Follow us on twitter and facebook for the latest developments.</p>

		<a name="q18"></a>

		<p>The NEC has free public wifi but, with so many people trying to access it, don't bet on it being reliable!</p>
		
		<a name="q19"></a>

		<a name="q21"></a>
		<h3>Do I need a press pass in order to film, conduct interviews or take photos at the event?</h3>
