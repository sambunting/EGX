#EGX

This is a website which I created for a college assignment. It is not the official EGX website. For the official website, visit [egx.net/egx](http://egx.net/egx).

All of the source code (excluding code written in `vendor/`) is written by hand by Sam Bunting. No CMS or site builder has been used. Twig has been used as the templating engine however.

The [live version of the site](http://egx.sambunting.biz) is hosted by [Media Temple (mt)](http://mediatemple.net).

##Just one quick note.

Everything is **unannotated** so I wish you good luck in finding what your after, I am not responsible for any injury and of course, may the odds be ever in your favor.
